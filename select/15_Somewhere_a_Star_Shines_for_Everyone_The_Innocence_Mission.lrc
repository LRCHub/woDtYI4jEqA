[00:08.42] Somewhere a star shines for everyone
[00:16.13] Somewhere one's shining for me
[00:23.97] No matter how rich or poor you are
[00:30.96] If you are born with the lucky star
[00:48.46] 
[00:39.54] Somewhere a star shines for everyone
[00:47.36] No matter who, you believe
[01:00.36] 
[00:54.51] La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[01:09.51] 
[01:02.26] Somewhere a star shines for me...
